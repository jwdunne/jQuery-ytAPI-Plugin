= YtApi with jQuery

== Install

This JS requires jQuery. In fact, it'd be pretty useless without it. All you
need to have some script tag thingies after bring jQuery into the equation:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.yt-api.js"></script>
    
== Usage

index.html has a basic example but you should use the YouTube Data API as a
reference since this is just a quick and dirty abstraction over that.
